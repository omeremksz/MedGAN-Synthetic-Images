# MedGAN-Synthetic-Images

Overview

This repository contains the resources for the project "Overcoming Medical Data Scarcity with GAN Generated Synthetic Images," which was presented at the International Conference on Radiology, Medical Imaging and Analysis (ICRMIA - 2024) in Sanliurfa, Turkey. The project focuses on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic skin lesion images from the HAM10000 dataset, aiming to enhance AI-driven medical diagnostics.
